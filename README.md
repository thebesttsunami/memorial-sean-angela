<p>The HTML and Wikitext codes in this repository are a token of our love for Sean and Angela, who have passed away.</p>

<p>Their stories and memories will always be eternal in the hearts of those who loved them. We are certain they never truly left us. They simply found a better and more comfortable place, in the hearts of those who loved them.</p>

<p>If any of Sean or Angela's family members see this repository, please be assured that I love these two poor children, their mother, and their coach very much. This is not meant to upset you, but to assure you that they remain in our hearts.</p>
